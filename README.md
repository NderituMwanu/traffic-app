### Install pip 

After youve downloaded python, open your terminal and type :

```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python

No need to create the virtual environment since you cloned it. But for future puropse you can create a virtual environment like this:

```
python3.8 -m venv --without-pip virtual
```

Install flask via your terminal using: 
```
pip install flask
```

Other packages you need to install, type the following:
```
pip install flask_mail

pip install flask_script

pip install Bootstrap
```

In the start.sh file, add your email and password in the provided fields and then run the following command:

```

```

You can now use the url provided after you run this command with no errors to get access to the file.
